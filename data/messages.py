    ABOUT A FEW SPECIAL OBJECTS, LIKE A BLACK ROD HIDDEN IN THE CAVE. THESE OBJECTS CAN BE MANIPULATED USING SOME OF THE
     ACTION WORDS THAT I KNOW. USUALLY YOU WILL NEED TO GIVE BOTH THE OBJECT AND ACTION WORDS (IN EITHER ORDER), BUT
     SOMETIMES I CAN INFER THE OBJECT FROM THE VERB ALONE. SOME OBJECTS ALSO IMPLY VERBS; IN PARTICULAR, "INVENTORY"
     IMPLIES "TAKE INVENTORY", WHICH CAUSES ME TO GIVE YOU A LIST OF WHAT YOU'RE CARRYING. THE OBJECTS HAVE SIDE
     EFFECTS; FOR INSTANCE, THE ROD SCARES THE BIRD. USUALLY PEOPLE HAVING TROUBLE MOVING JUST NEED TO TRY A FEW MORE
     WORDS. USUALLY PEOPLE TRYING UNSUCCESSFULLY TO MANIPULATE AN OBJECT ARE ATTEMPTING SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR (OR MY!)
     CAPABILITIES AND SHOULD TRY A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT TACK. TO SPEED THE GAME YOU CAN SOMETIMES MOVE LONG DISTANCES
     WITH A SINGLE WORD. FOR EXAMPLE, "BUILDING" USUALLY GETS YOU TO THE BUILDING FROM ANYWHERE ABOVE GROUND EXCEPT WHEN
      LOST IN THE FOREST. ALSO, NOTE THAT CAVE PASSAGES TURN A LOT, AND THAT LEAVING A ROOM TO THE NORTH DOES NOT
      GUARANTEE ENTERING THE NEXT FROM THE SOUTH. GOOD LUCK!''',

#  SECTION 11: HINTS.  EACH LINE CONTAINS A HINT NUMBER (CORRESPONDING TO A
#	COND BIT, SEE SECTION 9), THE NUMBER OF TURNS HE MUST BE AT THE RIGHT
#	LOC(S) BEFORE TRIGGERING THE HINT, THE POINTS DEDUCTED FOR TAKING THE
#	HINT, THE MESSAGE NUMBER (SECTION 6) OF THE QUESTION, AND THE MESSAGE
#	NUMBER OF THE HINT.  THESE VALUES ARE STASHED IN THE "HINTS" ARRAY.
#	HNTMAX IS SET TO THE MAX HINT NUMBER (<= HNTSIZ).  NUMBERS 1-3 ARE
#	UNUSABLE SINCE COND BITS ARE OTHERWISE ASSIGNED, SO 2 IS USED TO
#	REMEMBER IF HE'S READ THE CLUE IN THE REPOSITORY, AND 3 IS USED TO
#	REMEMBER WHETHER HE ASKED FOR INSTRUCTIONS (GETS MORE TURNS, BUT LOSES
#	POINTS).
